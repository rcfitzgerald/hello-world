# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow:
I am from Des Moines, Iowa and am a student in the Tippie College of Business studying Marketing and Business Analytics. I am projected to graduate May 2025. I work at the University of Iowa in the Admissions office as a Greeter for all the guests that come to visit the University daily. I have previously worked for Turck as Customer Service Support and worked closely with SAP. This summer, I have an Rotational Development internship with Principal Financial. I look forward to future opportunities that help me grow in my career.
